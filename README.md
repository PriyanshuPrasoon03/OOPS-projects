I completed these two Java projects that effectively applied key object-oriented programming concepts. The Communication Simulation project modeled interactions between devices using encapsulation and abstraction.  while the Marketplace Implementation created an interactive platform for buyers and sellers, demonstrating scalability and maintainability in software design.

## Projects

Project 1: Communication Simulation

Simulated a network of communication devices and channels using OOP principles. The project focused on encapsulation and abstraction to model complex interactions between devices while ensuring secure and efficient data transfer.

Project 2: Marketplace Implementation

Implemented a marketplace system where buyers and sellers interact. The project used OOP concepts like inheritance and encapsulation to manage users, products, and transactions while ensuring scalability and maintainability.
